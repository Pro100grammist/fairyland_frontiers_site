Fairyland Frontiers is an indie game that is essentially a 2D platformer with elements of a classic role-playing game. The gameplay involves players using a variety of combat and movement mechanics (double jumping, wall climbing, casting magic, turning levers, etc.) to complete challenging levels and overcome obstacles. But beyond a simple platformer, the game includes role-playing elements, offering a rich progression system. By completing quests and defeating enemies, players level up, giving them access to a skill tree filled with a variety of abilities and upgrades. The game's levels are non-linear, so those who dare to stray from the beaten path will find hidden valuable items from weapons and armor to alchemical potions and enchanted scrolls. The game has a trading system, so a wide range of items can be not only found but also purchased from merchants. Players can trade, exchanging their finds for necessary supplies or rare artifacts that will be useful to them. 
* The game is currently under development. The plans include, among other things, adding its own lore, new monsters of different difficulty levels, developing quests and a dialog system, as well as levels in various environments. Therefore, the world of Fairyland Frontiers will grow and develop with each update. Optimization, bug fixes, and additional content will be introduced regularly with patches and updates. 
** Fairyland Frontiers is a pet project from a non-professional developer whose main goal is to deepen his own experience in the Python programming language, OOP, and to gain experience in project management from the initial idea to the final implementation.
