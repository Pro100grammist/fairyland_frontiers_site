I'm an aspiring indie developer who loves pixel art, coffee, and long walks in dark dungeons. As a self-taught developer, I've learned a lot through trial and error and sometimes panic.
Now I'm building games to improve my Python skills and gain a deeper understanding of project development processes. Python is my current language of choice, but in the future I plan to learn the engines and frameworks that underpin the modern game industry.
This is my first experience, so please be careful. ðŸ˜Š
